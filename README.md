# Machine Learning for MHC I peptide classification
This repo is based upon a blog post by Leon Eyrich Jessen: 
https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/blog/dl-for-cancer-immunotherapy.html 

Here I present a variation on Leon's theme after I was kindly invited to present
at the Computational Biology Club Meeting at the University of Southampton on
April 25th 2018.

I took the invitation as an opportunity to learn a bit more about how peptide
prediction tools such as [NetMHC](http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHC/) work.

What follows is a toy model that attempts to classify peptides from my some of my
experiments according to one of five MHC class I allotypes present in the cells I
use.

This repository contains all the code and datasets.
